### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cole and I am currently a student at the University of Arizona for computer science. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and C++ at this time, but more focused on C# and the .NET framework
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything to help gain knowledge in the software space.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with minimal API deployments

Feel free to check out any of my projects and also contribute if you feel inclined!
